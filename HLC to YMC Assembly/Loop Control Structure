Translate a loop control structure to YMC assembly. Things to think about: 
    *In a loop, you will encounter conditional and unconditional jumps. How will you encode the jump address when you havent yet loaded the program into the memory and donâ€™t know that instruction's address? 
    *Maybe the function that 'loads' the program into the memory 'adjusts' the code before loading it? Maybe some other way?
